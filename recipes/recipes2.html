            <li>1 teaspoon ground turmeric

</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground coriander</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon water</li>
            <li>1 (15 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 cup plain yogurt</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>½ cup water</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon garam masala</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
   <h2>Steps</h2>
   <p>
       <ol>
           <li>Sprinkle the chicken breasts with 2 teaspoons salt.</li>
           <li>Heat the oil in a large skillet over high heat; partially cook the chicken in the hot oil in batches until completely browned. Transfer the browned chicken breasts to a plate and set aside.</li>
           <li>Reduce the heat under the skillet to medium-high; add the onion, garlic, and ginger to the oil remaining in the skillet and cook and stir until the onion turns translucent, about 8 minutes. Stir the curry powder, cumin, turmeric, coriander, cayenne, and 1 tablespoon of water into the onion mixture; allow to heat together for about 1 minute while stirring. Mix the tomatoes, yogurt, 1 tablespoon chopped cilantro, and 1 teaspoon salt into the mixture. Return the chicken breast to the skillet along with any juices on the plate. Pour 1/2 cup water into the mixture; bring to a boil, turning the chicken to coat with the sauce. Sprinkle the garam masala and 1 tablespoon cilantro over the chicken.</li>
           <li>Cover the skillet and simmer until the chicken breasts are no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Sprinkle with lemon juice to serve.</li>
       </ol>
